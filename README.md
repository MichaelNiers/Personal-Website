## My Personal-Website created for michaelniers.de

Tools used to build this website (in 2019, with only minor content updates since):


GitHub Pages - you can host any static website (HTML, CSS, JS) really easily using GitHub, totally for free!

The Site itself was build only with HTML, CSS and a bit JS.
